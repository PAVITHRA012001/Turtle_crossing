Turtle_Graphics_Coding
turtle is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas. The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle and this is what gives the library its name.
Using Turtle, we can easily draw in a drawing board. First we import the turtle module. Then create a window, next we create turtle object and using turtle method we can draw in the drawing board.
